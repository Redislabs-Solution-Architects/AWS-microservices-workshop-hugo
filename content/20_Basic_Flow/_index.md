### Introduction
Redis is known as a cache, and it's excellent at that job. Indeed, most people think that that is all it can do. However they’re missing out on its other capabilities; capabilities that take it far beyond a simple cache and make it a key part of any modern architecture.

This workshop will take you from the basic cache and introduce you to some of these other capabilities, showing you how those capabilities are used to advantage in an interactive application. We’ll give you hands-on experience with Redis, via the RedisInsights tool.
