# Redis - So Much More Than A Cache

Redis is a great cache, but it is so much more than that. This workshop will help you understand some of the many features that takes Redis beyond a cache. 

## Prerequisite Knowledge and Experience
Weâ€™re expecting you to be:

* comfortable using Git; 
* have Maven and Java installed locally; 
* can use Docker on your laptop;
* can install a simple application (RedisInsight). 


### Learning Objectives
- Understand Key Redis Features including Caching
- Become familiar with using RedisInsight

<p style='text-align: left;'>
Once you've completed this course you won't be able to look at Redis the same way ever again. This will change the way you think about Redis, how it can be used, and what its appropriate for. Please do not continue if you cannot cope with that change!
