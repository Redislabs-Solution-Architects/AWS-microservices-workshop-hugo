# Redis - So Much More than just a Cache
Redis is a great cache, but it is so much more than that. This workshop will help you understand just a few of the many features that takes Redis beyond a cache and into the world of a must-have data store for any modern, interactive application.

## Who is this workshop for
This workshop is intended for application developers and architects with some command line familiarity to give them some experience about using Redis in an interactive application. From a learning perspective the workshop is both application domain and language neutral: the techniques and examples can be applied to many different application domains and implemented in many different languages. (Of course we had to make concrete choices here and we've chose Movies and Java as our application domain and language, but these are entirely arbitrary.)
