### RedisInsight
[RedisInsight] is a great tool for interacting directly with Redis. You'll be using it extensively during this workshop to understand what Redis is doing for the application 'under the covers'.

Install [RedisInsight] on your laptop, then (assuming that the sample application is running), configure it by adding the following database:

![alt redis database configuration][rdb_config]

You'll end up at a window looking like this:

![add-database]

Click on the 'redis-service' database and you'll get to the actual database interaction window:

![redis-service]

Whenever we direct you to [RedisInsight](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) throughout the rest of the course this is the window you'll need to go to. We'll be directing you to various menu options shown on the left hand side of this window. Best to open this up in another tab now and keep it open for use later!
