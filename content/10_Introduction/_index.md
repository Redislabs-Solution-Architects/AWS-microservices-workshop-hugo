# Workshop Introduction
Redis is known as a cache, and it's excellent at that job. Indeed, most people think that that is all it can do. However they’re missing out on its other capabilities; capabilities that take it far beyond a simple cache and make it a key part of any modern architecture.

This workshop will take you from the basic cache and introduce you to some of these other capabilities, showing you how those capabilities are used to advantage in an example application, written in Java using SpringBoot. We shall simply use the application to show where Redis is providing value behind the scenese. This isn't a coding workshop.

However, to deepen your understanding of Redis itself we’ll give you hands-on experience with Redis, via the RedisInsights tool. We'll have you interacting with Redis and learning some of its key capabilities through this easy to use tool.
