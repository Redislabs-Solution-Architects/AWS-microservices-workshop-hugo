# Workshop Introduction
This workshop comprises:

* A pre-built Spring Boot application that is used as the vehicle to demonstrate what is possible using Redis 
* Some hands-on activities with Redis via the [RedisInsight] tool, so you can see what is happening from a Redis perspective and get a little deeper into understanding the underlying data technology. 

Our goal is to get you to _REDIS_-cover Redis: to understand its caching use case and how that has now been greatly extended by Redis' new and powerful capabilities. 

## Learning Objectives
Our learning objectives for you are that you'll:

- Understand the basic Redis use case of Caching
- Understand extended use cases involving indexes and querying
- Become familiar with using RedisInsight to interact directly with Redis


It is not our intent to teach your Redis, make you a Redis expert, or cover all of Redis. We don't expect you to be a SpringBoot aficionado or a Java guru. Redis can be used with dozens (60+ at last count) of languages, so you can continue to do what you do well in the language of your choosing. The idea here is to get you excited and interested to learn more about using Redis. For that we recommend [Redis University] - free online courses from the home of Redis

## Prerequisite Knowledge and Experience
For this Docker based version of the course we're expecting you to:

* Be comfortable using Git; 
* Have Maven and Java installed on your laptop;
* Be able to use Docker on your laptop;
* Be able to install a simple application ([RedisInsight]).
